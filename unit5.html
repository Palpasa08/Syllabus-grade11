        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="introduction">Programming Language:</h2></div>
        <p>In order to make communication between user and computer, we need a computer language that helps user to generate commands to perform as per the requirement. This language with which we can give instruction to the computer is known as programming language. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets including numbers, special symbol and alphanumeric values.

            Hence, the process of writing the programming language is known as programming and the person who writes program is programmers. </p>
        <div class="fbg" ><h2 id="ft"> Types of Programming Language</h2></div>
      <p> <ul>
            <li> <strong> Low level language: </strong> Low level language are the machine dependent language which means program written for one type of system cannot be run in another system. Developer should have detail analysis and knowledge about the system for which s/he is going to write a program for. Hence, programming in low level language is very much difficult and time consuming.  Low level language are the machine dependent language which means program written for one type of system cannot be run in another system. Developer should have detail analysis and knowledge about the system for which s/he is going to write a program for. Hence, programming in low level language is very much difficult and time consuming.  Different types of programming language are:
                <ol type="i"><li> Machine level language(1GL): This language consists a sequence of 0’s and 1’s to generate instruction. Since, it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by processor. So, it has higher execution speed. It is also a machine dependent language in which programmers should have detailed knowledge of the system.</li>
                <br>
                <strong> -Advantage:</strong>
                <ol>
                <li>It is directly understood by the processor so execution speed is relatively high.</li>
                <li>Language translator or processor is not needed.</li>
                <li>They can be used to program specific purpose computer.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <strong>-Disadvantage:</strong>
                <ol>
<li>  It is difficult and time consuming to develop and debug program.</li>
 <li>It is machine dependent language. So, program developed for one system cannot be operated in another system.</li>
                <li>All the syntax and commands are in the form of binary numbers which is difficult to remember.</li>
                <li>Programmers should have detail knowledge about particular system and its architecture.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <li>Assembly language(2GL): Assembly language are also an example of low-level language. In this language, instead of writing instruction in the series of 0’s and 1’s we can use mnemonics (symbolic instructions) like ADD, SUB, RST, DIV, MOD and so on. Since it is closer to machine level language, a programmer should have detailed knowledge about computer internal architecture. This language is faster in comparison to high level language. Since, this language is not directly understood by the computer, we need language translator like assembler to convert it into machine level language.
                </ol>
                </li>

                <br>
                <strong>-Advantage: </strong>
                <ol>
               <li> It is easier to write, debug and understand programming written in assembly level language compared to machine level language.</li>
                <li> Program execution is higher compared to high level language,
                </li>
                <li>Since they are machine dependent, they are used to develop different device drivers.</li></ol>
               <br>
<strong>-Disadvantage:</strong>
                <ol>
<li>  It is machine dependent language, i.e. program made for one processor doesn’t run in another processor.
</li>
                   <li>Use of mnemonics code makes assembly language much more complex.
                </li>
                <li>Program development and debugging is more difficult and time consuming compared to high level language.</li>
                </ol><br>
                <li> <strong> High level language: </strong>
                    <p>This language is close to English language. High level language code is written in English like structure using mathematical notation. Since it is similar to English language, it is easier to develop and debug the program. It is machine independent language (i.e. program developed for one processor can work on another processor). Since HLL (high level language) are not directly understood by the computers, we need language processor or translator such as complier and interpreter for converting program written in high level language to machine level language. FORTAN (Formula Translator) introduced on 1956 A.D is the first high level language. Nowadays there are many high-level languages like C, C++, python, JavaScript, etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>-Advantage: </strong>
                    <ol>
                   <li> Since it is closer to English language, program written in this language is easier to write, debug and understand.</li>
                    <li>Programmer doesn’t have to remember large number of mnemonics and other unusual codes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Program development is faster and requires less effort than other language.</li>
                   <br>
    <strong>-Disadvantage:</strong>
                    <ol>
    <li>  Program execution is slower compared to low level language.
    </li>
                       <li>Computer doesn’t understand high level language directly. So the program needs conversion before execution.
                    </li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol type="i"><li>Procedural oriented Language(3GL): This type of language is high level language which primarily focuses on procedure rather than on data. Hence, they are used to express the logic and the procedure of the program. Since it focuses only on procedure, it is complex and time consuming to write a large program. This type of language follows top to bottom approach i.e. main function is written at the bottom of the program. This type of language doesn’t pose important and powerful feature like data encapsulation, data inheritance, data extraction and so on. So, this type of language has less security compared to object-oriented language. Because of their flexibility, procedure language is able to solve verities of problem. Examples: C, FORTAN, QBasic, etc.</li>
<br>
                   <strong> -Advantage:</strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Program development and debugging is easier compared to low level language.</li>
                    <li>More advance and user-friendly software can be developed.</li>
                    <li>It is also a machine independent language.</li>
                    <li>It is used as general purpose programming.</li></ol>
                    <br>
                    <strong>-Disadvantage:</strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Language translator or processor is required to execute the program.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
                    <li>Data security is less in comparison to other high-level language.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <li>Problem/object Oriented Language(4GL): This is the advance form of high-level language which primarily focuses on data rather than procedure. It allows the user to specify what the output should be without describing all the detail (i.e. procedure) of how the data should be manipulated. This type of language follows bottom up approach. That means all main function are written at the bottom of the program whereas classes and object are described at top of the program. Since it has several powerful features such as data encapsulation, data extraction and inheritance, the data are more secure compared to procedure language. Examples: C#, C++, Java, etc.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                   <strong> -Advantage:</strong>
                    <ol>
<li>Web based application and software can be developed.</li>
<li>                    More advance and user-friendly software can be developed.
</li>                    <li>It is also machine independent language.</li>
</ol>
                    <br> 
                    <strong>-Disadvantage:</strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>
                    <li>Program execution is slower.</li>
                    <li>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented language.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <br> 
                <li> Natural Language (5GL): Natural language uses simple statement of common communication language where we could write statements that would look like normal sentences. It is still in developing stage; computer scientists are working hard for developing such language. However, programming language like PROLOG (programming logic) is currently in use. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>-Advantage: </strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li>It will be even easier to develop and debug the program.</li>
                    <li>It will also be machine independent language.</li>
                    <li>More advance and user-friendly program will be made.</li></ol>
<strong>                    Disadvantage:

<ol>        
                    <li>Language translator is required to execute the program.</li>

                    <div class="fbg"><h2 id="lt">Language translator/processor:</h2></div>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Assembler:</strong>These language translator/processor converts program written in assembly level language (source program) into machine understandable language (object language) Since assembly level language are closer to machine level language, the conversion taken by assembler is relatively less. It converts program at once into machine level language.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> Those language processors which helps to convert program written in high level language (source program) into machine level program (object program). It converts whole program into machine level language at once. It is the largest method of translating a program in which debugging is complex and time consuming. Programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. use complier</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpreter:</strong>This is the type of language which converts program written in high level language (source program) into machine level language (object program). It converts one statement at a time so its debugging can be easier and less time consuming. Its program execution is slower than that of compiler. Most of the new programming language use interpreter which allocate less memory space. Programs like BASIC, C#, Php, etc. use interpreter for conversion.</li>

      <div class="fbg"><h2 id="what is">What is c programming language?</h2></div>
      <p>C is a High Level Programming Language, developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T’s Bell Laboratories of USA, in 1970. It is a very powerful programming language. It is used for both system programming and application programming. So, often known as Middle Level Programming Language, also. It means, it supports or works as the low level language and high level language, both. </p><br>
      <div class="fbg"><h2 id="fetauresofc">What are the features of C?</h2></div>
      <ul type="a">
        <li>The program development is faster and more efficient. </li>
        <li>It has very powerful tools and keywords.
        </li>
        <li>It supports high level and level programming both, so known as mid level programming language.</li>
    <li>It has very powerful library functions set.
    </li>  
    <li>It is mostly used for System programming but very popular for Application programming, too.</li>
    <li>It is portable and flexible.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <div class="fbg"><h2 id="fund">Fundamentals of C</h2></div>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold"> C-tokens</span>
    <p>The set of identifiers, keywords, constants, variables and operators is known as C Tokens. It remains as a single unit and compiler does not break in the time of compilation. </p>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold">Identifiers</span>
    <p>Identifiers are names for entities in a C program, such as variables, arrays, functions, structures, unions and labels.</p>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold"> Keywords</span>
    <p>Keyword is a reserved word that is already stored by the c language developer. The reserved word cannot be used as the identifiers. There 32 Keywords in C according to the ANSI (American National Standard Institute) in c language. They are: void, printf, scanf, if, else, while, getch, do, for, break, continue etc </p>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold"> Data Types</span>
    <p> The term Data Types in any language refers to the types of data which can be used in the program execution for entering and manipulating as the values. In the same way, the data types in c also refer to the data types, which can be used as the values. Basically it is of four types. They are:int, float, void, char.</p>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold">Statements</span>
    <p>The set of keywords, identifiers, operators, variables and constants ended with the semicolon or a curly bracket is called statement. It is of two types:Simple statements and compound statements</p>
    <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold">Escape Sequence</span>
    <p>The symbol \ or ‘ is supposed as the Escape character. It means, the compiler of c programming language understands this character and the text after this to take as a special case. And the set of this symbol and the character behind it is known as the Escape Sequence. Some common escape sequences are:
        New Line	[\n],
        Horizontal tab	[\t],
        Null character	[\0],
        Quotation mark	[\”],
        Apostrophe	[\’],
        Backslash (\)	[\\].
        <span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold">Library Functions</span>
        <p>Functions are the independent sections or the block of statements given a specific name and they can be used by any program according to the requirements. They are developed to perform a certain task. Library functions are the ready-made formula-like functions stored in c language library. They can be used in any program. abs(), printf (), scanf (), clrscr(), getch(), strlen(), sqrt(), etc. are some examples of Library functions.</p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="opt">Operators</h2></div>
        <p>The symbols, which are used to operate on the operands for the mathematical and logical calculations are known as operators. C programming language has a rich set of built-in operators. Operator that requires two operands are binary (dyadic) operators, operators that require one operand is unary (monadic) and the operator that requires three operands is ternary operator. Eg. a+b, here + is an operator.</p>
        <br>
<img src="image copy 5.png" alt="operators" width="500">
<br>
<div class="fbg"><h2 id="csic">Control Structures in C</h2></div>
<p>If we need to execute other part of the programs rather from top to bottom or we need to divert the program flow from its normal execution. In such a case, we need some program statements, which are known as Control Structures. They are of three Types of control structure :<strong>sequence,selection and looping</strong></p>
<span style="color:rgb(19, 19, 107);font-weight:bold">Sequence:</span>
<p> Program generally flows from top to bottom.</p>

    <h3>Disadvantages of C:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>It does not contain runtime checking.</li>
        <li>There is no strict data type checking.</li>
        <li>As the program extends, debugging becomes more complex because it uses a compiler instead of an interpreter for compilation.</li>
        <li>Semi-colon is required for each statement.</li>
    </ol>
        </p>
        <div class="ff"><h3>4. What are data types? </h3></div>
        <p> Datatype specifies the type of data to be used in a program. Some common types of data types are:
Numeric( it is the combination of all the positive and negative whole number including zero.)
Character (it is the possible combination of all the alphanumeric values including especial symbol.)
        </p>
        <div class="ff"><h3>5. What are variables and constants? </h3></div>
        <p>Those entities which holds either numeric or alphanumeric values and changes its value throughout the time of program execution are called variables.Those entities which holds either numeric or alphanumeric values but does not change its value throughout the time of program execution are called constants.</p>
