        <!-- Introduction to Computer System -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Computer System</h2></div>
        <p>A computer system is an integrated set of hardware and software designed to process data and provide useful information. It consists of input devices, output devices, a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage devices. The primary purpose of a computer system is to perform tasks efficiently and accurately. Computers are used in various fields such as education, healthcare, business, entertainment, and research.</p>

        <!-- Components of Computer System -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="components">Components of Computer System</h2></div>
        <p>A computer system consists of the following components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices used to enter data into the computer. Examples include keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, and webcam.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices used to display or output data. Examples include monitor, printer, speakers, and projector.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The brain of the computer that processes data and executes instructions. It consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), and registers.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Temporary storage used to hold data and instructions during processing. It includes RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Devices used to store data permanently. Examples include hard disk, SSD (Solid State Drive), USB drive, and CD/DVD.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Input/Output Devices -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="input-output">Input/Output Devices</h2></div>
        <p>Input and output devices are essential for interacting with the computer system:</p>
        <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Displays visual output such as text, images, and videos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Produces hard copies of documents and images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Output audio data such as music and sound effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projector:</strong> Displays visual output on a large screen.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Memory -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="memory">Memory</h2></div>
        <p>Memory is a crucial component of a computer system. It is divided into two main types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Memory (Main Memory):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Volatile memory that stores data temporarily while the computer is running. It is faster but loses data when the power is turned off.</li>
                    <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Non-volatile memory that stores permanent data such as firmware and BIOS. It retains data even when the power is turned off.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Memory (Storage Memory):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hard Disk:</strong> Magnetic storage device used for permanent data storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong> Faster and more reliable than hard disks, with no moving parts.</li>
                    <li><strong>USB Drive:</strong> Portable storage device used to transfer data between computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>CD/DVD:</strong> Optical storage devices used for data backup and distribution.</li>
                </ul>

        </ol>

        <!-- CPU -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="cpu">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2></div>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer system. It performs all the processing tasks and controls the operation of other components. The CPU consists of three main parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Controls the flow of data and instructions between the CPU, memory, and other components.</li>
            <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Small, fast storage locations used to hold data and instructions during processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Storage Devices -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="storage">Storage Devices</h2></div>
