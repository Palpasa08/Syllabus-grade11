        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Internet</h2></div>
        <p>Internet is the global network of networks. or, It is huge collection of computers all over the world that is inter-connected to one another in various ways to form a web-net.</p>
        <div class="fbg" ><h2 id="ft">Internet services and applications</h2></div>
        <p><ol>
            <li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> WWW is a series of services that are interconnected through hypertext. It provides links in the web document. It is the most important service provided by the Internet. It was created in 1990 at the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, to exchange and share data through the Internet using the protocol known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
    
            <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> A web browser is a computer program that accesses web pages and displays them on a computer screen. It is client software that allows users to display and interact with a web page. Web browsers help find, retrieve, view, send, and receive information over the Internet. Without a web browser, we cannot open the WWW. Some popular web browsers are Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Deepnet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Mosaic.</li>
    
            <li><strong>FTP - File Transfer Protocol:</strong> It is an Internet tool that permits an Internet user to move or transfer a file from one computer to another. The files may contain data, graphics, text, etc.</li>

            <li><strong>IRC(Internet Relay Chat):</strong> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a huge multi-user live chat facility. There are a number of major IRC servers around the world, which are linked to each other. Anyone can create a channel and all others in the channel see anything that anyone types in a given channel.</li>
           <li><strong>Video Conference:</strong>  It is known as web cam chatting these days. This Video Conferencing uses the same technology as IRC but also provides sound and video pictures. It enables direct face-to-face communication across networks. It also provides real-time visual communications (online chat).</li>
           <li><strong>Universal Resource Locator (URL): </strong> URL is a unique address that identifies its location on the Internet. Web browsers utilize the URL to retrieve a file from the computer on which it resides. The format of the URL is given below:</li</p>
      <p> <ul>
       <li> http   -           protocol</li>

<li>www                 -           host computer name</li>

<li>com                  -           domain type</li></ul>
<li><strong>Navigators – Information Servers</strong> These are special features of Internet to discover, locate, and retrieve information on various objects. Some of the well-known utilities are Gopher, Archie, Hytelnet, WAIS, and WWW. The WWW navigator is the most popular and has resulted in the massive growth of Internet resources.</li>
    <li><strong>TELNET – Remote Login:</strong>  Telnet allows users to login to a host computer from a remote computer using a telnet program. In other words, it gives the user the opportunity to be on one computer system and work on another computer system, which may be across the street or thousands of miles away.</li>
        <li><strong>E-Fax (Electronic Fax):</strong> It is another facility available in the Internet to send and receive faxes directly on our computer. It is very same of E-mail. The E-Fax message first goes to the Internet server, then the Internet server sends it to its destination whereas E-mail message goes to the local file server.</li></p></ol>

    <div class="fbg"><h2 id="intro">Introduction to HTML</h2></div>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which are used to create web pages that are used in internet to exchange data and information. HTML file itself is a text file which contains several tags and attributes. HTML was develop by Tim Berner Lee that was based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The tags and attributes used to create HTML file are displayed using web browser. Web browser helps to understand all the tags and attributes given by the user and generate the contain of the page. The different version of HTML are: HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML2.0, HTML3.2, HTML 4.01 and now HTML 5.0.</p>

                <strong>Website:</strong> The collection of interrelated webpages is known as a website. It may contain any piece of information or may have information that is interrelated with several webpages connected through hyperlinks. All websites have two parts:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> The name used to access the website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Server:</strong> It is a storage location where every piece of information associated with the website is stored.</li>

        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="intr">Database Management System </h2></div>

            <p>
                Data are the raw facts and figures. Data are isolated, uninterpreted, and don't give any sense unless and until they are processed. Simply, they are the entities collected from the random world which undergo processing. For example, <em>Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara</em>.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>
                Information is the meaningful result obtained after processing data, which gives some meaning and sense. Generally, it is a processed version of data. For example, <em>Ram is a student whose age is 19, and he lives in Pokhara-12</em>.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Database</h2>
            <p>
                As we know, information is obtained after processing data. Hence, we need data processing to convert data into information. Therefore, the systematic and scientific arrangement and organization of data so that we can retrieve it whenever required quickly and easily is called a <strong>database</strong>. A database is an organized collection of data for converting data into information so that it can give some meaningful results. For example, <em>Dictionary, Mark ledger, Census, Telephone directory</em>, etc.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Database Management System (DBMS)</h2>
            <p>
                Since manual collection and organization of data are time-consuming, unsecured, and complex, there is an application program that helps to maintain a database, i.e., systematic and scientific organization and collection of data. This allows us to retrieve any piece of information within a fraction of time without any effort. Hence, the software or system built to fulfill the above requirements is known as a <strong>Database Management System (DBMS)</strong>. In other words, it is a collection of software that manages data stored in a database. The main purpose of DBMS is to store data, process it, and obtain desired information. For example, <em>MS-Access, MySQL, Oracle, FoxPro, dBase</em>.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It allows users to search quickly and easily.</li>
                <li>It helps to reduce data redundancy (repetition).</li>
                <li>It allows users to share data over a network.</li>
                <li>It helps in data security and privacy.</li>
                <li>It improves data inconsistency (variance).</li>
                <li>It provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Installation and operating costs are higher.</li>
                <li>It requires more disk space.</li>
                <li>It may sometimes have security and privacy issues.</li>
                <li>Technical manpower (DBA) is required to maintain and operate.</li>
            </ul>
