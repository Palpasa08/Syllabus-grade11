        <!-- What is Information Technology? -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="it">What is Information Technology?</h2></div>
        <p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is the combined form of Information and Communication Technology, which is highly used for the information flow and in many other fields. IT has made the world closer day by day. One can easily send and receive messages throughout the world within a second. It has been widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. It is being used as a learning and teaching tool in the sector of education. Distant learning has become possible due to the advancement of IT. It has been highly used in industries to control the quantity and quality of products. It is equally used for management in hospitals and for the treatment of patients. IT is being used in the sector of animation and other entertainment. Scientists can use computers or IT for their research and experiments. Space technology has become possible due to IT. Thus, it has many positive impacts on society. However, it also has some negative impacts. As the use of IT increases day by day, cybercrimes are also increasing. Cybercriminals can easily steal others’ information or data, disclose secrets, spread viruses in the network, and disturb social peace and security.</p>

        <!-- Information Security -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="security">Information Security</h2></div>
        <p>In a network or cyberspace, there is always a threat of cyberattacks, which may lead to the loss and damage of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activities. We need to adopt different measures while using computers to protect against intentional and accidental activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps to create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>
        <p>Information security can mitigate security threats and security attacks. A security threat is a possible danger that might cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and cause possible harm, whereas a security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter others' valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc.</p>
        <p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It means information is available only to authorized individuals. Unauthorized individuals or systems cannot use or process others' information without proper authorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It indicates the accuracy and completeness of data and information. Without proper authorization, data and information cannot be tampered with.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It means information must always be available as per the user's requirements. It generally refers to accessing valuable data and information whenever required within no time.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Cryptography -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h2></div>
        <p>The term "cryptography" is derived from the Greek word, which means “Secret writing.” Cryptography is the art and science of hiding information. It provides security for information. It is used for providing secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography mostly refers to encryption and decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (a message) into an unreadable format so that anyone who tries to see the message cannot read the original message. The plaintext is converted into unreadable text using a special algorithm and keys. The unreadable text is called ciphertext. This ciphertext is again converted into readable form through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also termed as encoding or enciphering, and its reverse process, decryption, is also termed as decoding or deciphering.</p>

        <!-- Digital Divide -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="digital-divide">What is Digital Divide?</h2></div>
        <p>The term "Digital Divide" is used for the gap between computer-literate and computer-illiterate people. It can also be said that it is a division between technical and non-technical manpower in the field. IT is a modern technology, and to use this technology, one must have sound knowledge of computers. However, there are still a great number of people who do not know how to operate computers. They do not understand computer-related terms. This difference or gap is called the digital divide. This term first came into practice in the mid-1990s through political speeches and news media. This division is increasing day by day between urban and rural areas, educated and uneducated people, rich and poor, and so on. It has become a global issue, and governments are trying to bridge this gap.</p>

        <!-- Computer Ethics -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="ethics">What are Computer Ethics or Cyber Ethics?</h2></div>
        <p>Computer ethics or cyber ethics are the set of moral principles or codes of conduct that should be strictly followed by computer professionals. The intention of computer or cyber ethics is to avoid criminal activities through the use of computers. The following are some examples of computer ethics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not use others' passwords.</li>
            <li>Do not steal others' information.</li>
            <li>Do not use computers to harm others.</li>
            <li>Do not disclose others' secrets.</li>
            <li>Do not spread viruses in the network.</li>
            <li>Do not copy licensed software that you have not paid for.</li>
            <li>Do not alter others' data.</li>
            <li>Do not take possession of others' intellectual property.</li>
            <li>Do not misuse electronic transactions.</li>
            <li>Do not use computers to bear false witness, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Cyber Crime -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="cyber-crime">What is Cyber Crime?</h2></div>
        <p>The act of misusing computers, the Internet, or other electronic media is called cybercrime. As the use of Information Technology increases, the act of cybercrime is also increasing day by day. The following are some examples of cybercrime:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Misuse of computers</li>
            <li>Spreading viruses</li>
            <li>Stealing others' information</li>
            <li>Pirating licensed software</li>
            <li>Disclosing others' secrets</li>
            <li>Misusing electronic transactions and electronic media</li>
            <li>Making rude and vulgar comments on the Internet on racial, communal, and other issues</li>
            <li>Altering others' data without permission</li>
            <li>Spying on others' information</li>
            <li>Cracking or hacking</li>
            <li>Password guessing</li>
            <li>Salami saving and data diddling</li>
            <li>Forgery</li>
            <li>DOS attack, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Cyber Law -->
        <div class="fbg"><h2 id="cyber-law">What is Cyber Law?</h2></div>
        <p>The law regarding the use of computers is called Cyber Law. It highly concerns the misuse of computers, the Internet, and other electronic media, which are specially used for information flow. Cyber ethics suggest not committing computer crimes or cybercrimes, but cyber law strictly defines the punishment in case of violation of the laws or cyber principles. Cyber law is in practice to support cyber ethics. The Nepal Government also issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (18th March 2005) as “The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005.”</p>
        <p>It has the following provisions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law</li>
            <li>Intellectual Property Law</li>
            <li>Copyright Law</li>
            <li>Trademark Law</li>
            <li>Semiconductor Law</li>
            <li>Patent Law</li>
            <li>Telecommunication Law</li>
            <li>Data Protection and Privacy Law</li>
        </ul>
